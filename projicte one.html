            If I start talking about my dad, I can’t stop. I’m just gonna say our life without you is nothing, I swear, because you are everything. If you weren’t with us, I don’t think we could be like we are right now.

My brother, Abdo El Allah, has three children and his own family in Asfi. I know it’s hard for him because he lives there but works here, so sometimes he doesn’t see his family for months — can you imagine?
He has many skills; in fact, he’s the best technician in our family, with eight years of experience. He’s very good at his job.
He also started learning French recently. Actually, he already has a good vocabulary — around a B2 intermediate level, which is really impressive. He has a great memory and loves learning; he takes his studies seriously.
Finally, after everything, Abdo is and will always be my only brother, and I’m proud to have him in my life.😎</td>

She is 30 years old, and honestly, she’s like the second mother of our home. She’s the symbol of kindness, and a true example of a faithful and respectful young woman. Everyone who knows her speaks about her gentleness and her pure heart.
She always helps others, and she never hesitates to do good deeds for anyone in need. What makes her even more special is her sensitivity — she can’t control her tears; her heart is soft, and her emotions are always sincere.
For me, she’s not only my sister, but also a source of peace, faith, and love in our family.🤭</td>

      <td>Now let’s talk about another sister, a bit younger — her name is Zineb.
She’s a true fighter in life, known for her strength and determination. Even though she was a little mischievous when she was young, she always had a pure and kind heart.
She has gone through many hard moments in her life, but despite all the difficulties, she remained patient and strong. She’s truly the symbol of patience in our family.
What we can say about her is simple: she was, she is, and she will always be our sister — forever in our hearts.
I also want to thank her for what she told me in the picture, and to apologize for the times I took her money without telling her. May God bless you, my dear sister Zineb, and may you always stay with us.🌿</td>

We grew up together — we played, we fought, we laughed, and we cried. But none of that ever changed our bond. That’s what real brothers and sisters are all about.

It’s hard to describe her, because she’s unique — truly one of a kind.
She loves fashion, enjoys going out, watching Korean dramas, and of course, she loves Capri! She’s the spoiled one in the family, yet somehow she always feels like she’s the one who’s not understood.

At the end of the day, I just want to tell her:
May God always keep you with me, my beautiful sister. ❤💖</td>

I’m a person who always tries to understand life and become better every day.
I’m not perfect, but I always do my best. I believe that everything happens for a reason, and I always try to learn from my mistakes.

I’m calm, serious when it’s needed, and honest in everything I do. I care about my family, my goals, and my future. I love to learn new things, improve myself, and stay disciplined.

Even when life is hard, I don’t give up. I believe in patience, hard work, and faith. I’m the kind of person who stays quiet but feels deeply inside.</td>
